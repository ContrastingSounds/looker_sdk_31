    Experimental Looker API 3.1 Preview

    This API 3.1 is in active development. Breaking changes are likely to occur to some API functions in future Looker releases until API 3.1 is officially launched and upgraded to beta status.  If you have time and interest to experiment with new or modified services exposed in this embryonic API 3.1, we welcome your participation and feedback!  For large development efforts or critical line-of-business projects, we strongly recommend you stick with the API 3.0 while API 3.1 is under construction.   # noqa: E501
